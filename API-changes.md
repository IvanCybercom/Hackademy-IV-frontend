#On the backend
##Projects:
Rename projectId to projectNumber or projectCode to avoid confusion.
every project has a list of images, please add allow saving and returning them.
the project has a address field, which is a string


##activities:
add the project ID, not the projectNumber(see projects above), to the activity fields.
We need to get all the activities of a project by the id of the project, not by the projectId.


##organizations: 
we look at the interface when the backend is ready for them.
